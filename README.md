Exercises in Clojure from [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html).

Many are simply copy-pasted from the book, with slight changes to port them from Scheme to Clojure.

Some are solutions to exercises.
